# QuickLayout

QuickLayout is a declarative layout library, built to support the adaptive layout needs of UIKit-first iOS apps.
This library adheres to the following core principles:

- Optional: It is not a replacement for UIKit, it is a simple abstraction allowing layout to be expressed declaratively.
- Simple: The API surface is extremely minimal, with concepts that are very familiar for most iOS engineers.
- Helpful: The minimal API we have helps solve real problems, and should make building UI feel delightful.

QuickLayout should stay true to these core values. It should not aim to solve problems outside the scope of UIKit layout, or add unnecessary features.
