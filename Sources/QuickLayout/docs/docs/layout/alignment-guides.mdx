# Alignment Guides

```swift
extension Element {
  func alignmentGuide(_ horizontalAlignment: HorizontalAlignment, computeValue: @escaping @Sendable (ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat) -> Element
  func alignmentGuide(_ verticalAlignment: VerticalAlignment, computeValue: @escaping @Sendable (ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat) -> Element
}
```

Alignment guides allow you to control how views align within a container like `HStack`, `VStack`, or `ZStack`.
By default, these stacks align their children based on standard alignment values (like `.center`, `.leading`, or `.top`).
However, you can use alignment guides to customize alignment behavior by defining your own rules for how each child should be positioned.

:::caution Propagation
Of note, alignment guides for default types are not recognized beyond the first multi-child container, however custom alignment guides
are. If you need complex alignment behavior spanning more than one tier of layout
container, create a custom alignment type for full control here. The example below does this.

### Examples

```swift
extension VerticalAlignment {
  private struct EmojiTitleAlignment: AlignmentID {
    static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
      context[VerticalAlignment.bottom]
    }
  }
  static let emojiTitle = VerticalAlignment(
    EmojiTitleAlignment.self
  )
}

var body: Layout {
  VStack(spacing: 30) {
    titleView
    HStack(alignment: .emojiTitle, spacing: 16) {
      for emojiViewData in emojiViews {
        VStack {
          emojiViewData.emojiView
          emojiViewData.emojiTitleView
            .alignmentGuide(.emojiTitle) { _ in 0 }
          emojiViewData.emojiDescriptionView
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Cases

Alignment guides are a great tool to use when a particular alignment type should mean something slightly different for your view.
Perhaps your view has some decoration beneath the focal element, but `.bottom` alignment should apply to the focal element and not
the content below it.

Or, perhaps you'd like `.center` horizontal alignment, but some views need adjustment to match this behavior. While this is possible
via other means, specifying alignment guides can be a natural, easy way to accomplish this.
