# Layout Direction

```swift
extension Element {
  func layoutDirection(_ direction: LayoutDirection) -> Element & Layout {
}
```

QuickLayout supports both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) directions, enabling seamless content layout across diverse languages and locales. By default, the direction is determined by the user's locale; however, you can utilise the layoutDirection modifier to override this setting for a specific tree of elements.

### Examples

```swift
var body: Layout {
  HStack {
    profilePhoto
    Spacer(8)
    userName
    Spacer()
  }
  .layoutDirection(.rightToLeft)
}
```
