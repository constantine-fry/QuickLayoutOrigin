# Fixed Frame

<img width="250" src={useBaseUrl('img/layout-elements/frame1.png')} />
<br/><br/>

```swift
extension Element {
  func frame(width: CGFloat? = nil, height: CGFloat? = nil, alignment: Alignment = .center) -> Element
}
```

The Fixed Frame positions its child element inside an invisible container of a given size.
If you omit a size (or pass nil), the frame will use the sizing behavior of its child element for that axis.
When using this method, you must provide at least one size constraint.

:::caution Frame doesn't change the size of the view

The `Frame` modifier does not directly change the size of its child view but acts like a "picture frame." It proposes the size to the child view, but the child may choose to have a smaller size. Therefore, the `Frame` modifier uses the `alignment` parameter to position the child within its own size.
:::

:::tip Use resizable modifier

To enforce a view uncoditionally acquire the size of the frame, wrap it with the `resizable` modifier.
```swift
var body: Layout {
  HStack {
    faceImageView
      .resizable()
      .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
    label
  }
}
```

### Alignment

The frame allows you to control the position of the child view within it's space with the `alignment` parameter.
See the image below demonstrating the frame with various alignments and labels.
