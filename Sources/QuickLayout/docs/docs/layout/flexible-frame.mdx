# Flexible Frame

```swift
extension Element {
  func frame(
    minWidth: CGFloat? = nil,
    maxWidth: CGFloat? = nil,
    minHeight: CGFloat? = nil,
    maxHeight: CGFloat? = nil,
    alignment: Alignment = .center
  ) -> Element & Layout
}
```

The Flexible Frame positions its child element inside an invisible flexible container of a given size constraints.
If you omit a constraint (or pass nil), the frame will use the sizing behavior of its child element for that axis.
When using this method, you must provide at least one size constraint.

:::caution Flexible Frame doesn't change the size of the view
The `Flexible Frame` modifier does not directly change the size of its child view but acts like a "picture frame." It proposes the size to the child view, but the child may choose to have a smaller size. Therefore, the `Flexible Frame` modifier uses the `alignment` parameter to position the child within its own size.

### Examples

```swift
var body: Layout {
  HStack {
    label1
      .frame(minWidth: 40, maxWidth: 80)
    label2
  }
}
```
