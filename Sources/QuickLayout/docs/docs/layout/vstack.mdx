# VStack

<img width="200" src={useBaseUrl('img/layout-elements/vstack1.png')} />
<br/><br/>

```swift
func VStack(
  alignment: HorizontalAlignment = .center,
  spacing: CGFloat = 0,
  @FastArrayBuilder<Element> children: () -> [Element]
)
```

VStack arranges child elements vertically and acquires the size of all children.
All child elements are layout even if they are not visible on screen. Use `UICollectionView` or `UITableView` to make infinitly scrollable lists.

```swift
var body: Layout {
  VStack {
    view1
    view2
    view3
  }
}
```


### Alignment

<img width="800" src={useBaseUrl('img/quickstart/img3.png')} />
<br/><br/>

You can control alignment of elements within stack with the `alignment` parameter:
```swift
var body: Layout {
  VStack(alignment: .leading) {
    view1
    view2
    view3
  }
}
```

### Spacing

A fixed amount of spacing can be added between every element via `spacing` parameter:

```swift
var body: Layout {
  VStack(spacing: 10) {
    label1
    label2
  }
}
```

### Spacer

A `Spacer` can be used to specify flexible spacing or fixed spacing:

```swift
var body: Layout {
  VStack {
    Spacer()
    label1
    Spacer(10)
    label2
    Spacer()
  }
}
```
### Performance Considerations

Up to two measurements may be performed to determine the size of certain child elements.
Fixed-size elements (e.g., .frame() or UIImage) are measured only once.
Fully flexible elements are not measured directly; instead, they are assigned a size based on the available space, which is proportionally distributed among all fully flexible views.

If a stack contains two or more partially flexible views (e.g., UILabel) and the proposed size is smaller than the intrinsic content size, the child elements may be measured multiple times.
A common indication of double measurements in a VStack is truncated multiline text.
When the proposed size is infinite, no double measurement occurs.

To avoid double measurement, use .layoutPriority() modifier to specify the order in which child elements should be measured.
